--     		SQL Overview			--
---------------------------------------------------
SQL is a language for handling database CURD ( create update read delete )
With SQL you can create databases and tables. Select specific piece of data, make changes, remove data and much mode
A Relational database consists of a collection of tables
Each tables has a defined set of coluns and rows containg data. Each row called a RECORD
The data between tables can be related to each other, This is why they are called "relational" databases
The collection of tables in a database is called the SCHEMA.
To begin with SQL, turn on server. It is running a database management system. DBMS for short.
WE connect to DBMS and then we create a database
