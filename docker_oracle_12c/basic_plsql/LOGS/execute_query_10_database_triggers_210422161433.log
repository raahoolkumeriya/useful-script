>>> DATABASE TRIGGERS <<<<
> : 5 type of triggers
>  - Data defination Language ( DDL ) triggers: Fire when you CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, or DROP object in databse schema.
to monitor poor programming practices creation or drop temporary tabels rather than use Oracle collections effectively in memory
Temporary tables can framant disk space and over tiem degrade perfomrance

> - Data Manipulation Language (DML ) or row-level triggers: Fire when you INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data from table
to audit, check, save and replace values before they changed.
Automatic numbering of pseudonumeric primary keys is frequently done using DML triggers

> - Compound triggers: Act as both statement- and row-level triggers when you INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE data form a table
Capture information at four points - BEFORE 1. firing statement 2. each row change from firing statement
AFTER  3. Each row change from the firing statement 4. firing statement
to audit, check, save and replace values before they changes

> - Instead of triggers: Enable you to stop performance of a DML statement and redirect the DML statement. Often use with Not updatable views

> - System or database event triggers: Fire when a system activity occurs in database
login and logoff events, enable you to track system events and map them to users
