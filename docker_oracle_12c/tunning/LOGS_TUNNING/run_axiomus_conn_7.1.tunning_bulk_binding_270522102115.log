---- how BULK Binding imporove PLSQL performance ?
> how PLSQL code is getting executed?
> PLSQL Engine ( execute all the procedureal code ) and SQL Engine (execute all the sql statements )
---------------------------------------------------
> PLSQL and SQL communicate as follows: To run a SELECT INTO or DML statement, the PLSQL engine sends the query or DML statement to the SQL Engine.
>> The SQL engine runs the query or DML statement and returns the result to the PLSQL engine.
> Asssigning values to PLSQL variable that appers in SQL statements is called binding.

--	 Context Switching	      --
----------------------------------------
-- Switch between PLSQL Engine and SQL Engine is called Context Switching.
-- Context switching has huge imapct in term of performance
----------------------------------------
--	  BULK Binding		     --
----------------------------------------
> Bulk bindind is a process in which instead of doing binding one by one because of context switching, the
>> entire information from the SQL statement will be binded back to the PLSQL variable either in a single switch
>>> or fewer numebr of switches. This is called BULK Binding.
----------------------------------------
-- Types of Binding availables	     --
----------------------------------------
>> In-Bind : The value form the PLSQL engine assignt the SQL engine, it happend wherever we INSERT, UPDATE or MERGE statements executes.
>> Out-bind : From the SQL statement information returning back to PLSQL variable. When and RETURNNGN INTO clause of an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
>> DEFINE : When a SELECT or FETCH statements assign a databse value to the PLSQL or host variable
----- TO implement Bulk binding ----
>>>>> FORALL
>>>>> BULK COLLECT clause
